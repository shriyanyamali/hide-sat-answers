# Hide SAT Answers

When reviewing the questions you got correct or incorrect on the official practice Bluebook SAT tests, you might want to reattempt some of the questions. This extension allows you to hide the correct answer and the answer you chose, so you can reattempt the question without already knowing the right answer.

## Features

- Toggle visibility of your **selected answers** and the **correct answers** on SAT practice detail pages.
- Choose to hide/show:
  - All answers
  - Only answers you got correct
  - Only answers you got incorrect
  - Show all answers (default)
- Remembers your preference across page reloads.
- Helps for studying and reattempting answers.

## Installation

1. Download the extension on [Firefox](todo).
2. Visit [mypractice.collegeboard.org](https://mypractice.collegeboard.org/) and click "Score Details" on a practice test to see the extension in action.
3. Click the dropdown button at the top-right corner of the page.
4. Select your preferred visibility mode:
    - Default (show all answers)
    - Hide All
    - Hide Correct
    - Hide Incorrect
5. The extension will immediately update the page and remember your choice.
